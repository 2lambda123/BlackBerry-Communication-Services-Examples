# BBM Enterprise SDK Click To Chat Sample

This directory contains sample code demonstrating how to integrate a chat
experience into your website with the BBM Enterprise SDK for JavaScript. This
app allows a user to click a button on a webpage to start a secure chat with a
predefined user or agent. The bbmChat widget handles the rendering of messages
within the chat, and allows the user to send text, picture, and file messages.
